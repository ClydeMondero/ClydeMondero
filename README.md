*A aspiring FullStack Web Dev*

I'm currently a 3rd year BSIT student at the Bulacan State University. Everyday I try to write code to improve. As of now I'm learning how to use frameworks in order to improve my workflow and overall quality of my projects. I like to create solo projects in web/app development.
